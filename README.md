## Automatic XML Serialisation for Scala

XML is weird, `scala.xml` too. Anyway sometimes one needs to expose XML and some help is always a plus.

This library is the usual Shapeless encoding / decoding, case classes / sealed traits from and to XML.

## Status


Early non-functional prototype, being written.
